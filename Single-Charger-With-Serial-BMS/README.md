PyQT5-No-Multiplus-Single-Charger-JBD-BMS.py    
This file is for a Raspi and a single Victron SmartSolar Charger. Also includes a Serial UART BMS (JBD in my case).    
I have no idea if this works with the other compatiable BMS's. I only have a JBD.

The connector included did not fit my BMS, YMMV. I cut the BMS BlueTooth cable in half and soldered the UART wire's to the connector wire's
